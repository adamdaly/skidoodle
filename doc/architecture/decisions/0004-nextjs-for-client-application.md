# 4. Next.js for Client Application

Date: 2025-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The client application requires a modern, scalable, and performant front-end framework. The application needs to support server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO optimization, and a smooth developer experience.

## Decision

Next.js will be adopted as the framework for developing the client application. Next.js is a React-based framework that provides out-of-the-box support for SSR and client-side rendering, along with built-in routing, API routes, and an optimized build system. This decision is based on the following factors:

- SEO and Performance: Next.js supports SSR which is critical for search engine visibility and fast initial page loads.

- Developer Productivity: The framework’s file-based routing and many built-in features reduce boilerplate and setup time.

- Ecosystem: Next.js has a strong community, extensive documentation, and integrates well with UX/UI design libraries.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences:

- Faster Development: Features like automatic code splitting, API routes, will accelerate development.

- Improved User Experience: SSR will ensure fast page loads and better SEO.

- Simplified Infrastructure: Next.js reduces the need for a separate backend server for rendering, as API routes can handle lightweight server-side logic.

- Scalability: The framework’s architecture supports scaling to larger applications with minimal refactoring.

### Negative Consequences:

- Learning Curve: It may need time to adapt to Next.js-specific concepts.

- Increase complexity when deploying the Client App to a service other than Vercel's own cloud platform.
